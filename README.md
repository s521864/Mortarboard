## Overview
Mortarboard seeks to provide functionality similar to the ‘classroom’ portion of the Tophat software suite.  Mortarboard should allow a professor to create polls, small in class quizzes, free response forms, etc. The teacher client should also allow for basic statistical analysis of student responses, as well as basic messages pushed back to students in the classroom. 

**Raise your hand:** ask anonymous questions of the teacher, increases student engagement with less anxiety about public engagement. 

## Minimum Viable Product
- Responsive web view for students (mobile and desktop?)
- Teacher client
- Classroom joining (possibly with unique classroom code?)
    - 4 digit classroom codes
- Anonymous student reporting optional
- Ask for s# for non anonymous reporting
