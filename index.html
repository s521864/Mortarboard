	<h1>Mortarboard</h1>
	<p>Mortarboard seeks to provide functionality similar to the ‘classroom’ portion of the Tophat software suite.  Mortarboard should allow a professor to create polls, small in class quizzes, free response forms, etc. The teacher client should also allow for basic statistical analysis of student responses, as well as basic messages pushed back to students in the classroom.</p>
